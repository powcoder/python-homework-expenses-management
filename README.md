The Assignment
This Python homework will involve implementing a system for managing expenses. You will
download the skeleton of the program, then implement the functions. The design of the
program has been set up for you.
In this system, users will be able to add and deduct expenses, update expenses, sort expenses,
and export filtered expenses to a file. The program will initially load a collection of expenses
from a .txt file and store them in a dictionary.

1. Complete the required functions
a. Implement all of the functions defined in expenses.py
i. Docstrings have already been provided
ii. You can create any number of helper functions (with docstrings)
iii. The main function has already been implemented for you
iv. Add brief comments to all non-trivial lines of code
b. Complete the unit testing in the testing file expenses_test.py
i. Where noted, write at least 2 additional test cases for each unit testing
function
2. Make sure your program and the unit testing file run without errors
------------------------------------------------------------
Evaluation
1. Did you implement the functions correctly? – 14 points
a. Does your program successfully load and parse the .txt file and store the
expenses in a dictionary database?
b. Can you add expenses to the system?
c. Can you update and deduct from expenses?
d. Does your program raise a RuntimeError if you try and deduct an invalid
amount?
2. Unit Testing – 9 points
a. Does your program pass all of the provided unit tests?
b. Did you write the additional required test cases for each function? Did you test
both typical examples and edge cases?
3. Coding Style – 2 points
a. Appropriate naming of variables
b. Naming of helper functions (with docstrings)
c. Clear comments in your code# python homework  expenses management代写
